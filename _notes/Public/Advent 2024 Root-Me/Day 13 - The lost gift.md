### summary

Some OSINT with a pcap file to find the trajectory of a drone, and it's last picture to guess the correct road on Google Maps.

### Solution

We open the pcap file and are immediately greeted with Broadcast frames showing the location of the drone. Drones broadcast [RemoteID](https://enterprise.dronenerds.com/blog/regulation/remoteid-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/) frames via Wifi and Bluetooth as a safety measure.

We copy paste the few last know locations and search on Google maps... last known location is in the middle of a lake in Britanny! (I went there, It's Broc√©liande, a beautiful place)!
But the last image of the drone was a road intersection. We know the drone continued it's path on a straight line. So let's trace it!

We the have very similar images... not surprising as the "drone image" had a Google Maps watermark on it ^^'

Careful, we landed just on the small road of the intersection, not the main one!

```python
"RM{"+ "Clos de la Terre Rouge".lower().replace(" ","") + "}"
	RM{closdelaterrerouge}
```
